    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2 class="subheader"><i>/əˈbaʊt/ /miː/</i></h2>

    <!-- Interests -->
    <p>I'm a <b>tech guy</b>. I've been playing with computers since my early life, and with GNU/Linux since I was nine years-old. I always try my best in learning something new
        when trying to resolve a problem. Most specifically, I like not only finding the <i>how</i> behind the solution, but also the <i>why</i>.</p>

    <p>I like to <b>keep things simple</b> and avoid overcomplicated logics that have too much going on, and rather prefer going for the cleanest alternative. This applies in many 
        fields; I am really picky regarding my code style and profile appearance; that's why I try to spread the least information around me.</p>

    <p>I started consuming <b>manga</b> and <b>anime</b> just recently. My favorite mangaka so far is <i>Tsukumizu</i>. Although his art and story are mostly 
        pessimistic, I find myself enjoying his way of talking to the reader as if he knew them since forever. Both of his work were heart-touching to me, especially 
        <i>Shimeji Simulation</i>.</p>

    <p>I barely listen to <b>music</b>, as you might have seen from my <i>last.fm</i> page, but I am a big fan of the british band <i>Jamiroquai</i>. Along with <i>Acid Jazz</i>, 
        one of the genres I recently started listening more and more is <i>Math Rock</i> and </i>Drum and Bass</i>, without excluding some Japanese bands of different genres,
         like <i>frederic</i> or well-known Vocaloid producers.</p>

    <!-- Projects -->
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Most of the repositories I have contributed to are related to both Android Open Source Project(s) and GNU/Linux, or adding localization to my native language for different
        projects and more. I always try my best to create something useful and adaptable for everyone and their needs.</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: -5px;">
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/AndroidDumps">dumpyara</a></b> is one of my most active projects right now. It's used by different Android maintainers for automatically
            extracting important partitions, useful during development.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/AntoninoScordino/www">www</a></b> is where I push changes of my own website, for which I have been dedicating a lot of time to, although 
            it's arguable look. But, after all, I've wrote that on my own, and I'm happy with the outcome.</li>
        <li>I also have some contributions in different community-driven projects like <i>LineageOS</i> and <i>helluvaOS</i>. Some of these commits had caught the interest of 
            other developers, making me proud of them.</li>
    </ul>
